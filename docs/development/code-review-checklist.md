# Code Review Checklist

## Overview
This comprehensive checklist ensures all code changes meet the established standards for the Pond Digging Calculator project, covering functional programming best practices, performance, testing, and security considerations.

## Functional Programming Best Practices

### Pure Functions ✓
- [ ] All calculation functions are pure (no side effects)
- [ ] Functions consistently return the same output for identical inputs
- [ ] No global state modifications within functions
- [ ] Side effects are isolated to specific update functions or commands

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Pure calculation function
calculateExcavationRate : CubicYards -> Minutes -> CubicYards
calculateExcavationRate bucketCapacity cycleTime =
    let
        cyclesPerHour = 60.0 / cycleTime
        theoreticalRate = cyclesPerHour * bucketCapacity
    in
    theoreticalRate * excavatorEfficiencyFactor

-- ❌ BAD: Function with side effects
calculateExcavationRateWithLogging : CubicYards -> Minutes -> CubicYards  
calculateExcavationRateWithLogging bucketCapacity cycleTime =
    Debug.log "Calculating rate" (bucketCapacity, cycleTime)  -- Side effect!
    -- calculation logic
```

### Immutability ✓
- [ ] No modification of existing data structures
- [ ] Record updates use proper Elm update syntax
- [ ] List operations create new lists instead of modifying existing ones
- [ ] Model updates follow Elm architecture patterns

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Immutable record update
updateEquipment : Equipment -> Equipment
updateEquipment equipment =
    { equipment 
        | isActive = True
        , lastUpdated = currentTime
    }

-- ❌ BAD: Would be mutable (not possible in Elm, but conceptually wrong)
-- equipment.isActive = True  -- This doesn't exist in Elm
```

### Function Composition ✓
- [ ] Complex operations use pipeline operator (|>) for readability
- [ ] Function composition preferred over nested function calls
- [ ] Data transformations use map, filter, fold appropriately
- [ ] Functional patterns preferred over imperative-style loops

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Clear pipeline composition
processEquipmentList : List RawEquipment -> List Equipment
processEquipmentList rawEquipment =
    rawEquipment
        |> List.filter .isAvailable
        |> List.map validateEquipment
        |> List.filterMap Result.toMaybe
        |> List.sortBy .priority

-- ❌ BAD: Nested function calls (less readable)  
processEquipmentList rawEquipment =
    List.sortBy .priority 
        (List.filterMap Result.toMaybe 
            (List.map validateEquipment 
                (List.filter .isAvailable rawEquipment)))
```

### Error Handling ✓
- [ ] Result types used instead of Maybe for operations that can fail
- [ ] Error types provide specific, actionable information
- [ ] All pattern matches are exhaustive
- [ ] Error propagation handled appropriately (fail-fast vs. collection)

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Specific error information with Result
validateBucketCapacity : Float -> Result ValidationError CubicYards
validateBucketCapacity capacity =
    if capacity <= 0 then
        Err (ValueTooLow capacity 0.1)
    else if capacity > 15.0 then
        Err (ValueTooHigh capacity 15.0)
    else
        Ok capacity

-- ❌ BAD: Maybe loses error context
validateBucketCapacity : Float -> Maybe CubicYards
validateBucketCapacity capacity =
    if capacity > 0 && capacity <= 15.0 then
        Just capacity
    else
        Nothing
```

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Data Structures ✓
- [ ] Appropriate data structure choice (List vs Array vs Dict)
- [ ] Lazy evaluation used where beneficial
- [ ] Tail recursion implemented for large data sets
- [ ] Minimal data copying in transformations

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Tail-recursive implementation
sumEquipmentCosts : List Equipment -> Float -> Float
sumEquipmentCosts equipment acc =
    case equipment of
        [] -> acc
        first :: rest ->
            sumEquipmentCosts rest (acc + first.dailyCost)

-- ❌ POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC: Non-tail recursive (could cause stack overflow)
sumEquipmentCosts : List Equipment -> Float
sumEquipmentCosts equipment =
    case equipment of
        [] -> 0
        first :: rest ->
            first.dailyCost + sumEquipmentCosts rest
```

### Algorithm Efficiency ✓
- [ ] O(n) complexity documented for functions processing lists
- [ ] Unnecessary iterations avoided (multiple passes combined where possible)
- [ ] Early termination implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Expensive operations memoized or cached when beneficial

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Single pass with early termination
findFirstActiveEquipment : List Equipment -> Maybe Equipment
findFirstActiveEquipment equipment =
    case equipment of
        [] -> Nothing
        first :: rest ->
            if first.isActive then
                Just first
            else
                findFirstActiveEquipment rest

-- ❌ BAD: Multiple unnecessary passes
findFirstActiveEquipment equipment =
    equipment
        |> List.filter .isActive  -- Full pass 1
        |> List.sortBy .priority  -- Full pass 2 (unnecessary sorting)
        |> List.head             -- Only needed first item
```

### Memory Usage ✓
- [ ] Large data structures not kept in memory unnecessarily  
- [ ] String concatenation done efficiently
- [ ] List operations avoid creating intermediate lists where possible
- [ ] JSON decoding/encoding optimized for large payloads

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Efficient string building
buildEquipmentSummary : List Equipment -> List String -> String
buildEquipmentSummary equipment acc =
    equipment
        |> List.map equipmentToString
        |> String.join "\n"

-- ❌ BAD: Inefficient string concatenation
buildEquipmentSummary equipment =
    List.foldl (\eq acc -> acc ++ equipmentToString eq ++ "\n") "" equipment
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage ✓
- [ ] Every public function has at least one test
- [ ] Both success and failure cases tested for Result-returning functions
- [ ] Edge cases identified and tested (empty lists, boundary values)
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete workflows

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive test coverage
suite : Test
suite =
    describe "Equipment Validation"
        [ test "should_accept_valid_bucket_capacity" <|
            \_ ->
                validateBucketCapacity 2.5
                    |> Expect.equal (Ok 2.5)
        
        , test "should_reject_negative_bucket_capacity" <|
            \_ ->
                validateBucketCapacity -1.0
                    |> Expect.equal (Err (ValueTooLow -1.0 0.1))
                    
        , test "should_reject_excessive_bucket_capacity" <|
            \_ ->
                validateBucketCapacity 20.0
                    |> Expect.equal (Err (ValueTooHigh 20.0 15.0))
        ]
```

### Test Quality ✓
- [ ] Test names describe expected behavior clearly
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] Test data is realistic and represents actual use cases
- [ ] Assertions verify specific expected outcomes

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Descriptive test name and specific assertion
test "should_calculate_correct_timeline_for_mixed_equipment_fleet" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            equipment = [excavator25, bulldozer15, dumpTruck10]
            pondVolume = 1000.0
        in
        calculateTimeline equipment pondVolume
            |> Result.map .days
            |> Expect.equal (Ok 5.2)

-- ❌ BAD: Vague test name and unclear assertion
test "timeline_test" <|
    \_ ->
        calculateTimeline someEquipment someVolume
            |> Expect.notEqual (Err "error")
```

### Test Documentation ✓
- [ ] Complex test scenarios have explanatory comments
- [ ] Test data construction is clear and well-documented
- [ ] Integration test workflows are documented step-by-step
- [ ] Performance test expectations are documented with rationale

## Security and Validation

### Input Validation ✓
- [ ] All user inputs validated at boundaries
- [ ] Validation errors provide helpful feedback without exposing internals
- [ ] Numeric inputs checked for reasonable ranges
- [ ] String inputs sanitized and length-limited

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive input validation
validatePondDimensions : RawPondInputs -> Result (List ValidationError) PondDimensions
validatePondDimensions inputs =
    let
        lengthResult = validateDimension "length" inputs.length 1.0 500.0
        widthResult = validateDimension "width" inputs.width 1.0 500.0  
        depthResult = validateDimension "depth" inputs.depth 0.1 20.0
    in
    Result.map3 PondDimensions lengthResult widthResult depthResult
        |> Result.mapError (\errors -> [errors])
```

### Data Safety ✓
- [ ] No sensitive information logged or exposed
- [ ] Configuration data validated before use
- [ ] External data sources validated and sanitized
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive system information

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Safe error message without system details
handleConfigError : ConfigError -> String
handleConfigError error =
    case error of
        ConfigFileNotFound ->
            "Configuration file is missing. Please check installation."
        ConfigParseError ->
            "Configuration file format is invalid. Please verify syntax."
        -- Don't expose file paths or system details
```

### Type Safety ✓
- [ ] Custom types used instead of primitive types for domain concepts
- [ ] Type aliases provide meaningful abstractions
- [ ] Pattern matching is exhaustive for all union types
- [ ] Phantom types used where appropriate for additional type safety

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Domain-specific types instead of primitives
type alias EquipmentId = String  -- Could be phantom type for stronger safety
type alias CubicYards = Float
type alias Currency = Float

-- ❌ BAD: Generic primitive types lose domain meaning
calculateCost : String -> Float -> Float -> Float  -- Unclear what parameters represent
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions ✓
- [ ] Types use PascalCase (EquipmentType, ValidationError)
- [ ] Functions use camelCase (calculateTimeline, validateInput)
- [ ] Constants use camelCase (defaultWorkHours, maxBucketCapacity)
- [ ] Test functions use descriptive_with_underscores

### Documentation ✓
- [ ] All public functions have comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Complex algorithms have explanatory comments
- [ ] Business logic rationale is documented
- [ ] Module headers explain purpose and usage

```elm
-- ✅ GOOD: Complete function documentation
{-| Calculate the optimal equipment mix for a pond digging project.

    Uses industry-standard ratios to determine the most cost-effective
    combination of excavators, bulldozers, and support equipment.

    ## Parameters
    - `projectRequirements`: Pond specifications and timeline constraints
    - `availableEquipment`: Fleet of equipment available for assignment

    ## Returns
    - `Ok equipmentMix`: Optimized equipment allocation
    - `Err InsufficientEquipment`: Not enough equipment for project requirements

    ## Business Rules
    - Ratio: 1 bulldozer per 3 excavators for optimal soil movement
    - Safety margin: 20% capacity buffer for weather delays and downtime

    ## Examples
    ```elm
    optimizeEquipmentMix standardProject fullFleet
    --> Ok { excavators = 3, bulldozers = 1, dumpTrucks = 2 }
    ```
-}
optimizeEquipmentMix : ProjectRequirements -> List Equipment -> Result EquipmentError EquipmentMix
