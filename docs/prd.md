# Pond Digging Calculator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Provide construction professionals with instant, accurate pond excavation timeline calculations through a device-appropriate interface
• Enable competitive bidding by delivering reliable time estimates that professionals can trust for client presentations and project planning
• Bridge the gap between complex construction software suites and basic mental math with a purpose-built, accessible calculation tool
• Deliver professional estimation capabilities optimized for desktop/tablet work sessions with simplified mobile reference functionality
• Support mixed equipment fleet scenarios for realistic project planning while maintaining calculator-app simplicity on mobile devices

### Background Context
Construction estimators and superintendents currently lack dedicated, accessible tools for pond excavation timeline calculations, forcing them to rely on rough estimates or navigate complex software suites designed for comprehensive project management rather than quick calculations. This creates inefficiencies in estimation workflows, reduces confidence in bids, and presents accessibility barriers for blue-collar professionals who need immediate results during client meetings and project planning sessions.

The Pond Digging Calculator addresses this gap by providing a client-side web application built in Elm that delivers real-time calculations through device-appropriate interfaces - comprehensive mixed fleet capabilities on desktop/tablet for detailed estimation work, and phone calculator simplicity on mobile for quick field reference.

### Service Architecture
Client-side functional architecture using Elm for MVP phase. The application operates entirely within the browser with pure functional calculation logic, immutable data structures, and clear separation between calculation engine and UI components. Future phases will add F# backend maintaining functional programming consistency across the full stack.

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing approach using Elm's built-in testing framework for calculation accuracy validation and UI component testing. Focus on test-driven development for calculation logic to ensure professional-grade reliability. Manual testing protocols for cross-device compatibility and user experience validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Language Choice:** Elm frontend selected for type safety, reliability, and zero runtime exceptions critical for professional construction tool credibility
- **Functional Programming Patterns:** Pure functions for all calculations, immutable data structures throughout, and functional composition for complex equipment fleet calculations
- **Static Hosting:** Client-side architecture enables deployment via GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar static hosting services, eliminating server infrastructure costs for MVP
- **Build-Time Configuration:** Equipment defaults compiled statically at build time from /config/equipment-defaults.json, eliminating HTTP dependencies and enabling offline-first operation. Configuration changes require rebuild and redeploy for consistency and reliability.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Target modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+) without polyfills, leveraging native ES6+ features through Elm compilation
- **Performance Optimization:** Sub-second calculation updates through efficient functional algorithms and minimal DOM manipulation via Elm Architecture
- **Future F# Integration:** Backend architecture planned for F# when data persistence, analytics, or API integrations are needed in post-MVP phases
