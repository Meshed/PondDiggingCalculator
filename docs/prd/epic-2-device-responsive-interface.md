# Epic 2: Device-Responsive Interface

Implement adaptive UI complexity that delivers comprehensive calculation features with rich visual interface on desktop/tablet devices while providing simplified calculator-app experience on mobile devices, ensuring the tool adapts appropriately to how construction professionals work across different device contexts.

## Story 2.1: Desktop/Tablet Rich Interface
As a construction estimator working on detailed projects,
I want access to comprehensive calculation features with visual aids,
so that I can perform thorough estimation work during planning sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Desktop/tablet interface displays all input fields with descriptive labels and units
2. Visual representations of equipment (excavator/truck icons or graphics) enhance understanding
3. Input fields grouped logically with clear sections for excavator, truck, and project parameters
4. Results display prominently with additional context (e.g., "Estimated completion: X days")
5. Interface utilizes available screen space effectively without feeling cramped or sparse

## Story 2.2: Mobile Calculator Simplicity
As a construction professional needing quick field calculations,
I want a simplified mobile interface that works like my phone's calculator,
so that I can get immediate results without complexity or confusion.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mobile interface presents only essential input fields for single equipment configuration
2. Interface design mirrors familiar calculator app patterns and layout conventions
3. Large, easily tappable input areas optimized for finger interaction
4. Minimal visual clutter with focus on input/output clarity
5. Results displayed prominently with clear visual emphasis

## Story 2.3: Cross-Device Functionality Validation
As a user switching between devices,
I want consistent calculation accuracy and core functionality,
so that I can trust the tool regardless of which device I'm using.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Identical calculation results across all device interfaces for same input values
2. All input validation rules applied consistently across device breakpoints
3. Real-time updates function properly on all target device types
4. Default values populate correctly on all interfaces
5. Core functionality works reliably across target browsers on all device types
