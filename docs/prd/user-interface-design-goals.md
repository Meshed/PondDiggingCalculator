# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The Pond Digging Calculator delivers a professional-grade estimation tool that adapts to how construction professionals actually work - providing rich, comprehensive functionality on desktop/tablet devices where detailed estimation sessions occur, while offering the familiar simplicity of a phone calculator app for quick mobile reference. The interface prioritizes immediate utility through smart defaults and real-time calculations, ensuring new users see results within 10 seconds without data entry.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Real-time calculation updates:** All values update instantly as users modify inputs, providing immediate feedback similar to spreadsheet cell calculations
- **Smart defaults with override capability:** Pre-populated realistic values enable instant utility while allowing full customization for specific project needs
- **Progressive disclosure:** Desktop/tablet interfaces reveal mixed fleet capabilities and contextual help, while mobile interfaces focus on essential inputs only
- **Calculator app familiarity:** Mobile interaction mirrors universal phone calculator patterns for zero learning curve adoption

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Calculator Interface (All Devices):** Primary calculation screen with equipment inputs and timeline results
- **Mixed Fleet Management (Desktop/Tablet Only):** Equipment addition/removal interface for complex projects
- **Help/Tooltip Overlay (Desktop/Tablet Only):** Contextual assistance without navigation away from calculations
- **Results Display:** Clear timeline output with visual emphasis on final day calculation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
WCAG AA compliance to ensure usability across the target audience's varying technology comfort levels, with particular attention to clear typography and intuitive navigation for high school education level users.

## Branding
Professional construction tool aesthetic with clean, utilitarian design that conveys reliability and precision. Interface should feel like professional equipment - sturdy, dependable, and purpose-built rather than consumer-oriented or playful.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web Responsive with desktop/tablet-first comprehensive interface design and mobile-optimized simplified calculator experience across modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).
