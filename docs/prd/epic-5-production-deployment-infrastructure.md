# Epic 5: Production Deployment & Infrastructure

Implement configuration management system and production deployment pipeline that enables reliable hosting, easy maintenance, and sustainable operations for the Pond Digging Calculator while supporting future updates and enhancements.

## Story 5.1: Configuration Management System
As a developer maintaining the application,
I want easily updateable configuration files for default values,
so that I can adjust equipment specifications and settings without code changes or redeployment.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Default equipment values stored in separate JSON configuration file
2. Configuration file loading implemented with error handling and fallback values
3. Default values easily modifiable through configuration without touching application code
4. Configuration changes take effect on application reload without build process
5. Configuration file structure documented for future maintenance

## Story 5.2: GitHub Pages Deployment Setup
As a developer,
I want detailed GitHub Pages deployment configuration and procedures,
so that I can deploy the application reliably to production hosting.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated deployment to GitHub Pages
2. Build process includes Elm compilation, asset optimization, and Tailwind CSS processing
3. GitHub repository settings configured for Pages deployment from gh-pages branch
4. Custom domain configuration documented with DNS setup instructions
5. HTTPS certificate provisioning verified and documented
6. Deployment pipeline includes rollback procedures for failed deployments
7. Branch protection rules established to prevent direct pushes to deployment branch

## Story 5.3: User Onboarding Experience
As a first-time user,
I want clear guidance on how to use the calculator effectively,
so that I can quickly understand the tool's capabilities and get useful results.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Welcome overlay or introductory message for first-time visitors
2. Key features highlighted through progressive disclosure or guided tour
3. Example calculation scenario provided to demonstrate tool capabilities
4. Clear call-to-action buttons guide users through their first calculation
5. Help system easily discoverable without being intrusive
6. Mobile onboarding optimized for touch interactions and simplified workflow

## Story 5.4: Construction Equipment Research & Validation
As a developer,
I want accurate default values based on real construction equipment specifications,
so that the calculator provides realistic and trustworthy results for professional users.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Research completed on typical excavator bucket capacities (0.5-15 cubic yards)
2. Research completed on typical excavator cycle times (0.5-10 minutes)
3. Research completed on typical dump truck capacities (5-30 cubic yards)
4. Research completed on typical truck round-trip times (5-60 minutes)
5. Default values validated against industry standards and manufacturer specifications
6. Configuration file populated with researched values and documented sources
7. Value ranges validated for reasonableness with construction professionals

## Story 5.5: Performance Monitoring & Optimization
As a project maintainer,
I want visibility into application performance and user experience,
so that I can identify and resolve issues that affect professional users.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Basic client-side performance monitoring implemented without external dependencies
2. Application load time optimization techniques applied for construction site internet connections
3. Performance budgets established for critical user interactions (sub-second calculations, 3-second load time)
4. Browser console logging available for basic performance debugging during development
5. Performance monitoring framework ready for future metrics expansion in post-MVP phases

## Story 5.6: Documentation & Maintenance Framework
As a future developer or maintainer,
I want comprehensive documentation and maintenance procedures,
so that I can understand, modify, and extend the application effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Technical documentation covers architecture, build process, and deployment procedures
2. Configuration management procedures documented with examples
3. Testing procedures documented for validation of changes
4. Code structure documented following Elm conventions and functional programming patterns
5. Maintenance runbook created for common operational tasks
