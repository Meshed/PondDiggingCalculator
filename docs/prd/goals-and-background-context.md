# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Provide construction professionals with instant, accurate pond excavation timeline calculations through a device-appropriate interface
• Enable competitive bidding by delivering reliable time estimates that professionals can trust for client presentations and project planning
• Bridge the gap between complex construction software suites and basic mental math with a purpose-built, accessible calculation tool
• Deliver professional estimation capabilities optimized for desktop/tablet work sessions with simplified mobile reference functionality
• Support mixed equipment fleet scenarios for realistic project planning while maintaining calculator-app simplicity on mobile devices

## Background Context
Construction estimators and superintendents currently lack dedicated, accessible tools for pond excavation timeline calculations, forcing them to rely on rough estimates or navigate complex software suites designed for comprehensive project management rather than quick calculations. This creates inefficiencies in estimation workflows, reduces confidence in bids, and presents accessibility barriers for blue-collar professionals who need immediate results during client meetings and project planning sessions.

The Pond Digging Calculator addresses this gap by providing a client-side web application built in Elm that delivers real-time calculations through device-appropriate interfaces - comprehensive mixed fleet capabilities on desktop/tablet for detailed estimation work, and phone calculator simplicity on mobile for quick field reference.
