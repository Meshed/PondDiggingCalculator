# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Calculator

Establish functional project infrastructure with Elm architecture and deliver a working pond digging timeline calculator that provides instant, accurate calculations through real-time input updates, enabling construction professionals to get immediate timeline estimates for basic pond excavation scenarios.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup
As a developer,
I want to establish the core Elm project structure with testing framework,
so that I have a reliable foundation for building calculation features with confidence in code quality.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Elm project initialized with elm.json configuration and src/ directory structure
2. Elm testing framework configured with example test that passes
3. Basic build process established that compiles Elm to JavaScript without errors
4. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Elm projects
5. README.md created with project setup and build instructions

## Story 1.2: Core Calculation Engine
As a construction estimator,
I want to input basic excavation parameters and see timeline calculations,
so that I can get immediate pond digging estimates for project planning.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Input fields accept excavator bucket capacity (cubic yards), cycle time (minutes), truck capacity (cubic yards), truck round-trip time (minutes), and daily work hours
2. Calculation engine computes total timeline in days based on pond volume and equipment specifications
3. Result displays timeline rounded up to whole days as required for project scheduling
4. All calculations use pure functional approach with no side effects
5. Basic validation ensures all inputs are positive numbers

## Story 1.3: Smart Default Values
As a new user,
I want to see realistic equipment values pre-populated in all fields,
so that I can understand the tool's purpose and get useful results without data entry.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All input fields display realistic default values based on common construction equipment
2. Default values represent typical mid-range excavator and truck specifications
3. Default configuration produces reasonable timeline estimate for reference pond size
4. Users can immediately see calculated result upon page load within 10 seconds
5. Default values can be easily modified while maintaining calculation functionality

## Story 1.4: Basic Responsive Foundation
As a construction professional,
I want the calculator interface to adapt to my device screen size,
so that I get an appropriate experience whether I'm doing detailed estimation work or quick field calculations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Interface automatically detects and adapts to screen sizes from 320px (mobile) to 1920px+ (desktop)
2. CSS breakpoints established for mobile (<768px), tablet (768px-1024px), and desktop (>1024px) layouts
3. Typography and spacing scale appropriately across all device sizes
4. Touch targets meet minimum 44px requirement for mobile interfaces
5. All input elements remain accessible and functional across device breakpoints

## Story 1.5: Elm Coding Standards & Patterns
As a developer,
I want established coding standards and patterns for the Elm codebase,
so that I can maintain consistency and quality throughout development.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Elm coding style guide documented with naming conventions and formatting rules
2. Module organization patterns established for types, components, utils, and pages
3. Function documentation standards defined with required docstrings for public functions
4. Error handling patterns documented using Result types and validation approaches
5. Code review checklist created covering functional programming best practices
6. Example code templates provided for common patterns (components, validation, calculations)

## Story 1.6: Real-time Updates
As a construction professional,
I want calculations to update instantly when I change any input value,
so that I can explore different scenarios quickly during estimation sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Timeline result updates immediately when any input field value changes
2. No page refresh or button click required to trigger recalculation
3. Updates occur within 100ms of input change for responsive user experience
4. Invalid inputs display current valid calculation while showing error state
5. Calculation accuracy maintained across all real-time updates
