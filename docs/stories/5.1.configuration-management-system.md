# Story 5.1: Configuration Management System

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** developer maintaining the application,
**I want** build-time configuration integration for default values,
**so that** I can adjust equipment specifications via JSON config files that are baked into the compiled application at build time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build process integrates config/equipment-defaults.json into compiled Elm application
2. Generated ConfigGenerated.elm module provides type-safe access to configuration  
3. Configuration changes require rebuild/redeploy (build-time configuration system)
4. Default values easily modifiable through JSON configuration files
5. Configuration integration properly connected to existing application initialization

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] AC 1: Verify Build Process Integration with config/equipment-defaults.json
  - [x] Confirm generate-elm-config.js correctly processes config/equipment-defaults.json
  - [x] Verify ConfigGenerated.elm is properly generated during build process
  - [x] Ensure build scripts (npm run build, npm run dev) include config generation
  - [x] Test that configuration changes require rebuild to take effect

  - [x] Import Utils.ConfigGenerated module in Main.elm initialization
  - [x] Replace any hardcoded default values with ConfigGenerated.staticConfig
  - [x] Update equipment initialization to use generated configuration defaults

  - [x] Verify all equipment defaults come from config/equipment-defaults.json
  - [x] Confirm validation rules are sourced from configuration
  - [x] Test that project defaults (dimensions, work hours) use configuration
  - [x] Remove any remaining hardcoded values in favor of configuration
- [x] AC 4: Validate Build-Time Configuration Integration
  - [x] Test configuration changes require rebuild to affect application
  - [x] Verify no runtime HTTP calls are made for configuration
  - [x] Confirm application works entirely offline after build
  - [x] Test that config validation occurs during build process
- [x] AC 5: Document Build-Time Configuration System
  - [x] Document config/equipment-defaults.json schema and editing

  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide for configuration issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 4.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Successfully implemented professional display components with device-responsive patterns
- Enhanced Theme.elm with professional styling functions and device-responsive design
- Error handling patterns using Result types proven successful in validation systems
- Type-safe patterns with custom types (ConfidenceLevel, ValidationError) should be applied to configuration loading
- Performance requirements maintained at <100ms response time - configuration loading should not impact this

### Current Build-Time Configuration System Analysis
[Source: config/equipment-defaults.json + config/generate-elm-config.js]
The existing build-time configuration system provides:

**Current Structure:**
- Equipment defaults for excavators and trucks with realistic values
- Fleet limits (maxExcavators: 10, maxTrucks: 20) 
- Validation rules with min/max ranges for all input types
- Project defaults (work hours, pond dimensions)
- Version tracking and comprehensive documentation comments

**Build Integration:**
- `generate-elm-config.js` transforms JSON into `Utils.ConfigGenerated.elm`
- Build process includes `npm run generate:config` in all workflows
- Generated module excluded from git via .gitignore
- Type-safe Elm configuration with no runtime dependencies

**Areas Needing Integration:**
- Connect ConfigGenerated.staticConfig with Main.elm initialization
- Replace hardcoded defaults in application with configuration
- Ensure validation system uses configuration ranges
- Complete documentation of build-time configuration workflow

### Data Models for Configuration Management
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#application-model]
Current Model structure supports configuration loading:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { excavators : List Excavator         -- Will be initialized from config defaults
    , trucks : List Truck                 -- Will be initialized from config defaults  
    , projectConfig : ProjectConfiguration -- Will use config default values
    , validationState : ValidationState   -- Will use config validation rules
    , -- other fields
    }
```

### Configuration API Specification
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#configuration-api-json-loading]
Configuration file structure already defined:
```elm
type alias ConfigFile =
    { version : String
    , defaults : DefaultValues
    , validation : ValidationRules
    , ui : UiSettings
    }
```

JSON structure matches current config.json format with additional error handling requirements.

### Build-Time Configuration Error Handling
[Source: config/generate-elm-config.js]
Build-time configuration system handles errors during build process:
- JSON parsing errors halt build with clear error messages
- Missing configuration files fail build process cleanly
- Invalid configuration structure prevents successful compilation
- No runtime error handling needed - configuration baked into compiled code
- Build validation ensures configuration integrity before deployment

### File Locations for Build-Time Configuration Integration
[Source: Current codebase structure + build system]
Implementation paths for build-time configuration:
- Configuration source: `config/equipment-defaults.json` (ALREADY EXISTS)
- Build script: `config/generate-elm-config.js` (ALREADY EXISTS) 
- Generated module: `frontend/src/Utils/ConfigGenerated.elm` (AUTO-GENERATED)
- Main integration: `frontend/src/Main.elm` (UPDATE to import ConfigGenerated)
- Application initialization: Update to use ConfigGenerated.staticConfig

### Build-Time Configuration Implementation Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration-over-code + build system]
Critical standards for build-time configuration:
- "Configuration Over Code: Equipment defaults, validation rules, and UI settings must be in JSON config files, never hardcoded"
- All configuration baked into Elm code at build time via ConfigGenerated module
- No runtime JSON loading - purely compile-time integration
- Type-safe configuration access through generated Elm types
- No magic numbers - all defaults sourced from documented JSON configuration

### Tech Stack Requirements for Build-Time Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + build system]
- Configuration Storage: JSON files processed at build time
- Build Tool: Node.js script transforms JSON to Elm modules
- Elm Compiler: Compiles generated configuration into application
- No Runtime Dependencies: Zero HTTP requests, fully offline after build

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
Build-time configuration provides optimal performance:
- No configuration loading at runtime - zero performance impact
- Configuration values compiled into application code
- No HTTP requests for configuration data
- Real-time calculation updates remain <100ms with compiled config values

### Integration with Existing Equipment and Validation Systems
[Source: Current codebase structure]
Configuration management must integrate with:
- Existing EquipmentList.elm component for default equipment creation
- Current validation system using ValidationError types
- ProjectForm.elm for default project configuration values
- Main.elm application initialization sequence

## Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

### Test File Locations

- Build process successfully generates ConfigGenerated.elm from equipment-defaults.json
- Generated configuration provides correct default values for equipment and validation
- Configuration changes require rebuild to take effect (no runtime updates)
- Application works entirely offline with no HTTP configuration requests
- All equipment defaults sourced from ConfigGenerated.staticConfig
- Validation rules properly loaded from generated configuration
- Build fails cleanly when configuration JSON is malformed
- Documentation accurately describes build-time configuration workflow
