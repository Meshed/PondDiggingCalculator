## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 3.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Successfully implemented device-responsive architecture with shared state management
- Established pattern of presentation-only views using shared application state
- Theme and responsive utilities provide consistent styling patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage patterns established with 344 passing tests
- Key learning: Device type affects presentation only, not state structure

### Help System Component Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
Help system must adapt to device capabilities:
- Desktop/Tablet: Full tooltip system with hover/click interactions
- Mobile: Simplified help through enhanced labels and placeholders
- DeviceAdaptiveInterface manages responsive behavior based on screen size

### UI State Requirements for Help System
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
Help system will require additional UI state in Model:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { -- existing fields...
    , helpTooltipState : Maybe HelpTooltipState -- Track active tooltip
    , deviceType : DeviceType -- Used for help system adaptation
    }

type alias HelpTooltipState =
    { fieldId : FieldId
    , isVisible : Bool
    , position : TooltipPosition
    }
```

### Help Content Structure
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#application-model]
Help system will use existing FieldId structure for consistency:
```elm
type HelpFieldId
    = ExcavatorHelp EquipmentId ExcavatorField
    | TruckHelp EquipmentId TruckField  
    | PondHelp PondField
    | ProjectHelp ProjectField
```

### Component Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md]
Help system integrates with existing components:
- **EquipmentFleetManager**: Add help icons to equipment input fields
- **ProjectConfigurationManager**: Add help icons to project input fields  
- **DeviceAdaptiveInterface**: Adapt help display based on device type
- **ValidationEngine**: Ensure help system doesn't interfere with validation

### Help Content Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]
Help content should be stored in JSON configuration files for easy updates:
- Equipment help content: `frontend/public/help-content.json`
- Configuration structure similar to existing `config.json` pattern
- Content loading via Utils.Config.elm module

Expected help-content.json structure:
```json
{
  "equipmentHelp": {
    "excavatorBucketCapacity": {
      "title": "Excavator Bucket Capacity",
      "description": "The amount of dirt the excavator bucket can hold in one scoop.",
      "typicalRange": "0.5 to 15.0 cubic yards",
      "examples": ["Small excavator (CAT 305): 0.7 cubic yards", "Large excavator (CAT 374): 4.2 cubic yards"],
      "tips": "Larger buckets move more dirt per cycle but take longer to fill and dump."
    }
  }
}
```

### Styling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#tailwind-class-constants]
Help system styling must use Tailwind class constants from Theme module:
- Define tooltip classes as Elm constants for compile-time checking
- Use existing responsive utilities from Styles/Responsive.elm
- Follow component styling patterns from Styles/Components.elm

### Tooltip Implementation Requirements  
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
HelpTooltip component requirements:
- Pure presentation component with no internal state
- Receives tooltip content and position via props
- Uses Tailwind CSS for positioning and styling
- Implements accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
Help system must not impact calculation performance (<100ms requirement):
- Help tooltip display/hide should not trigger calculations
- Help content loading should not block initial application load
- Use lazy loading for help content if necessary

### Mobile Interface Adaptations
[Source: architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
Mobile help system requirements:
- Replace tooltips with enhanced input labels and placeholders
- Use `shouldShowAdvancedFeatures : DeviceType -> Bool` to conditionally show help
- Ensure help text doesn't overflow mobile layout containers
- Consider collapsible help sections for mobile if needed
