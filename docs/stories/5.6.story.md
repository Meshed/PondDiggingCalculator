### Performance Considerations

**No performance impact from documentation.** Build validation confirms:
- Build completes successfully in ~5 seconds
- Bundle size remains optimal (~26KB gzipped JS, ~4KB gzipped CSS)  
- All 486 tests pass in 248ms
- Performance metrics maintained within established budgets

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

This story represents exemplary work in technical documentation creation. The developer has produced a complete maintenance framework that will significantly improve developer onboarding, operational efficiency, and system maintainability.

The documentation framework successfully addresses all stakeholder needs:
- Future developers have comprehensive architecture and code structure guidance
- Operations team has detailed runbooks and troubleshooting procedures  
- QA processes have complete testing documentation and validation procedures
- Configuration management is fully documented with examples and best practices

**Recommendation:** This story can be moved directly to Done status.
