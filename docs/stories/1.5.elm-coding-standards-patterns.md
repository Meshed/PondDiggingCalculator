## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4, the following coding patterns and standards are already established and working:
- Elm 0.19.1 project with proper module structure (Types/, Utils/, Styles/, Components/)
- elm-test framework configured and working (86 total tests passing)
- Type safety with custom types (DeviceType enum instead of primitive strings)
- Pure functional approach maintained throughout codebase
- Comprehensive documentation with docstrings for all public functions
- Tailwind CSS class constants defined in Theme modules
- Result type usage for error handling and validation
- Descriptive test names using underscores (should_detect_mobile_device_below_768px)

### Current Project Structure Analysis
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, current project inspection]
The project currently follows the defined architecture structure:

```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical standards already established in the codebase:
- **Type Safety First**: Use custom types instead of primitives (DeviceType vs String) ✓
- **Pure Function Calculations**: All calculation logic uses pure functions ✓
- **Configuration Over Code**: Equipment defaults in JSON config files ✓
- **Validation at Boundaries**: Input validation with inline error display ✓
- **Error Result Types**: Use Result type for operations that can fail ✓
- **No Magic Numbers**: Named constants for calculation values ✓
- **Tailwind Class Constants**: CSS classes defined as Elm constants ✓
- **Test-Driven Calculations**: Unit tests for all calculation functions ✓

### File Locations for Documentation
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Documentation should be created in:
- **Coding Style Guide**: `docs/development/elm-coding-standards.md` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- **Module Organization**: `docs/development/module-organization-guide.md` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- **Documentation Standards**: `docs/development/function-documentation-guide.md` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- **Error Handling Patterns**: `docs/development/error-handling-patterns.md` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- **Code Review Checklist**: `docs/development/code-review-checklist.md` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- **Pattern Templates**: `docs/development/code-templates/` directory (NEW DIRECTORY NEEDED)
  - `component-template.elm`
  - `validation-template.elm`
  - `calculation-template.elm`
  - `utility-template.elm`

### Naming Convention Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Established naming conventions to document:
```elm
-- Types: PascalCase
type DeviceType = Mobile | Tablet | Desktop
type alias CalculationResult = { ... }

-- Functions: camelCase
calculateTimeline : List Equipment -> Float
validateInput : String -> Result ValidationError Float

-- Variables: camelCase
bucketCapacity : Float
pondVolume : CubicYards

-- Constants: camelCase
defaultWorkHours : Float
excavatorEfficiencyFactor : Float

-- Modules: PascalCase
Utils.Calculations
Types.Equipment

-- Test Functions: descriptive_with_underscores
should_calculate_correct_timeline_for_single_equipment
should_validate_positive_bucket_capacity
```

### Documentation Standards Pattern
[Source: previous story implementations, architecture/coding-standards.md]
Every public function follows this documentation pattern:
```elm
{-| Calculate the hourly excavation rate for a single excavator.
    Takes bucket capacity in cubic yards and cycle time in minutes.
    Returns cubic yards per hour accounting for real-world efficiency.
-}
calculateExcavatorRate : CubicYards -> Minutes -> CubicYards
```

### Error Handling Patterns
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, current codebase analysis]
Current Result type patterns established:
```elm
-- Validation with specific error types
validateBucketCapacity : Float -> Result ValidationError CubicYards

-- Error type definitions
type ValidationError
    = ValueTooLow Float Float
    | ValueTooHigh Float Float
    | InvalidFormat String

-- Result chaining for validation pipelines
validateAllInputs : InputData -> Result ValidationError ValidatedInputs
```

### Testing Standards Pattern
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md, current test files]
Current testing patterns to document:
- Test file organization: `frontend/tests/Unit/` and `frontend/tests/Integration/`
- Test naming: `should_[expected_behavior]_[conditions]`
- Test structure using elm-test framework
- 86 total tests currently passing
- Test coverage includes unit tests for calculations, validation, and component behavior

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Elm 0.19.1 with elm-test framework for testing
- Pure functional programming patterns required
- No runtime exceptions allowed (enforced by Elm compiler)
- Immutable data structures only
- Type safety enforced at compile time

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Test File Locations
This story doesn't require new test files since it focuses on documentation creation. However, the coding standards should establish:
- **Unit Test Standards**: `frontend/tests/Unit/` structure for new modules
- **Integration Test Standards**: `frontend/tests/Integration/` for component tests
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive function names using underscores
```elm
-- Good test structure example
test "should_calculate_correct_timeline_for_single_equipment" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            excavator = testExcavator 2.5 2.0
            result = calculateTimeline [excavator]
        in
        case result of
            Ok calculation ->
                calculation.timelineInDays
                    |> Expect.equal 1
            Err error ->
                Expect.fail ("Calculation failed: " ++ Debug.toString error)
```
