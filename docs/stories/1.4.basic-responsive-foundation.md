## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3, the following is established and working:
- Configuration system with JSON decoders in `Utils/Config.elm` can load default values
- Core calculation engine performs calculations with pure functions
- Form components in `Components/ProjectForm.elm` handle input and validation
- Results display in `Components/ResultsPanel.elm` shows calculation output
- Real-time calculation updates are implemented in Main.elm
- Default values are pre-populated and calculations trigger immediately

### Data Models Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#application-model]
The story uses existing DeviceType model structure:
```elm
type DeviceType
    = Mobile    -- < 768px
    | Tablet    -- 768px - 1024px  
    | Desktop   -- > 1024px
```

Device detection needs to be added to Model:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { message : String
    , config : Maybe Config
    , formData : Maybe FormData
    , calculationResult : Maybe CalculationResult
    , deviceType : DeviceType  -- NEEDS TO BE ADDED to existing model
    }
```

### DeviceAdaptiveInterface Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
Key interfaces required:
- `detectDevice : () -> DeviceType` - Browser window size detection
- `shouldShowAdvancedFeatures : DeviceType -> Bool` - Device capability filtering
- `getLayoutClasses : DeviceType -> String` - Responsive CSS class generation
- `adaptComponentForDevice : DeviceType -> Component -> Component` - Component adaptation

Dependencies: Browser.Dom for size detection, CSS media queries, conditional rendering
Technology: Elm Browser.Dom, Tailwind CSS responsive classes

### Responsive CSS Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required file structure for responsive styles:
- `frontend/src/Styles/Theme.elm` - Tailwind class definitions with responsive variants
- `frontend/src/Styles/Components.elm` - Component-specific responsive styles  
- `frontend/src/Styles/Responsive.elm` - Device-specific styling constants

### File Locations and Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Device detection utility: `frontend/src/Utils/DeviceDetector.elm` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- Device types: Add to `frontend/src/Types/Model.elm` (UPDATE EXISTING)  
- Responsive styles: `frontend/src/Styles/Responsive.elm` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- Theme definitions: `frontend/src/Styles/Theme.elm` (EXISTS, needs responsive enhancements)
- Component styles: `frontend/src/Styles/Components.elm` (NEW FILE NEEDED)
- Equipment card component: `frontend/src/Components/EquipmentCard.elm` (NEW COMPONENT NEEDED)
- Tailwind config: `frontend/tailwind.config.js` (needs responsive breakpoint configuration)
- Test files: `frontend/tests/Unit/ResponsiveTests.elm` (elm-test framework available)

### Touch Target Requirements
[Source: AC 4 - Touch targets meet minimum 44px requirement]
All interactive elements must be minimum 44px √ó 44px for mobile accessibility:
- Form input fields and labels
- Equipment card buttons (add, remove, edit)
- Results panel interactive elements
- Navigation elements

### Responsive Breakpoint Strategy
[Source: AC 2 - CSS breakpoints for device categories]
Tailwind configuration needed:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      'mobile': '320px',
      'tablet': '768px', 
      'desktop': '1024px',
      'wide': '1920px'
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Responsive Adaptation Patterns
[Source: architecture/components.md, architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Each component needs device-specific behavior:
- **EquipmentCard**: Stacked layout on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- **ProjectForm**: Single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop
- **ResultsPanel**: Condensed view on mobile, detailed breakdown on desktop
- **ValidationMessage**: Inline on desktop, overlay/toast on mobile

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety First**: Use DeviceType custom type, not string primitives
- **Device-Responsive Logic**: Components must check device type and adapt functionality
- **Tailwind Class Constants**: Define Tailwind classes as Elm constants in Theme module
- **Pure Function Calculations**: Device detection functions must be pure

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Elm 0.19.1 with Browser.Dom for window size detection
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for utility-first responsive styling
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout without dependencies
- Maintain pure functional approach for all responsive logic

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Test File Locations
- **Unit Tests**: `frontend/tests/Unit/ResponsiveTests.elm` for device detection logic (elm-test available)
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress framework needs to be setup first - current testing uses elm-test only

### Test Standards
- Use elm-test framework with descriptive function names using underscores
- Test device detection accuracy at breakpoint boundaries
- Test component adaptation for each device type
- Test touch target accessibility requirements

### Required Test Coverage
- Test device detection for each breakpoint (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px+)
- Test component layout adaptation for Mobile, Tablet, Desktop
- Test touch target minimum size requirements (44px √ó 44px)
- Test typography and spacing scaling across device sizes
- Test all input elements remain functional across breakpoints
- Test window resize handling and dynamic device type updates

### Test Pattern Examples
```elm
test "should_detect_mobile_device_below_768px" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            windowSize = { width = 600, height = 800 }
            deviceType = DeviceDetector.detectDevice windowSize
        in
        Expect.equal deviceType Mobile

test "should_provide_44px_minimum_touch_targets_on_mobile" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            mobileClasses = Theme.getButtonClasses Mobile
        in
        String.contains "min-h-11" mobileClasses
            |> Expect.equal True
```

### E2E Test Examples
```javascript
describe('Responsive Behavior', () => {
    it('should_adapt_layout_for_mobile_viewport', () => {
        cy.viewport(375, 667) // iPhone size
        cy.visit('/')
        cy.get('[data-testid="equipment-card"]').should('have.class', 'flex-col')
        cy.get('[data-testid="form-button"]').should('have.css', 'min-height', '44px')
    })
})
```
