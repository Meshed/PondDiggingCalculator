## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Build-time configuration system with Utils.ConfigGenerated successfully implemented
- npm run generate:config integration proven to work reliably in build pipeline
- Build process validation and error handling patterns established
- Comprehensive testing approach with integration tests validated deployment workflow
- Documentation with troubleshooting guides proven effective for operational procedures

### GitHub Actions Deployment Architecture
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]
**Current Architecture Requirements:**
- Platform: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Build Command: `npm run build` (Parcel bundling with Tailwind CSS processing)  
- Output Directory: `frontend/dist/` containing optimized static files
- CDN/Edge: GitHub Pages global CDN for worldwide content delivery

**Deployment Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
# Template from deployment-architecture.md
name: Deploy Static Site
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  ELM_VERSION: '0.19.1'
jobs:
  test: # Run tests first
  deploy: # Deploy only after tests pass
```

### Tech Stack Requirements for Deployment
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Critical Technologies for Deployment:**
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Latest) - Built into GitHub, no additional tools needed
- Build Tool: Elm Compiler (0.19.1) - Type checking and JavaScript compilation
- Bundler: Parcel (2.0+) - Zero-config bundling with hot reload and optimization
- Frontend Framework: Elm (0.19.1) - Compiled to JavaScript for static hosting
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (3.4+) - Utility-first styling with purging for small bundles

### Project Structure for Deployment Pipeline
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#github-workflows]
**Expected GitHub Actions Location:**
```
├── .github/                              # CI/CD workflows
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── elm-ci.yml                   # Elm build and test pipeline
│       ├── deploy-static.yml            # Deploy to GitHub Pages
│       └── fsharp-ci.yml               # Future F# backend CI
```

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- Existing: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (basic CI without deployment)
- Required: Replace with comprehensive `deploy-static.yml` for GitHub Pages deployment
- Frontend build output: `frontend/dist/` directory for static file deployment

### Current Build Process Integration Requirements
[Source: Current package.json + config system]
**Essential Build Steps for Deployment:**
1. Configuration generation: `npm run generate:config` (creates Utils/ConfigGenerated.elm)
2. Elm formatting validation: `npm run format:check` (prevents deployment of unformatted code)  
3. Project compilation: `npm run build` (Parcel bundling with Tailwind processing)
4. Test execution: `npm test` (comprehensive test suite validation)

**Build Dependencies from Tech Stack:**
- Node.js 18+ for npm scripts and build tooling
- Elm 0.19.1 for frontend compilation
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for styling with build-time purging

### GitHub Pages Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]
**Repository Configuration:**
- Deploy from: gh-pages branch (automated by GitHub Actions)
- Source folder: root (contains all static files from frontend/dist/)
- Domain configuration: Custom domain support with CNAME file
- HTTPS: Enforced with auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificates

**Expected Deployment URLs:**
- Production: https://your-domain.github.io/PondDiggingCalculator
- With custom domain: https://your-custom-domain.com

### Deployment Pipeline Security and Protection
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#environments]
**Branch Protection Requirements:**
- Main branch: Require status checks, prevent direct pushes
- gh-pages branch: Automated deployment only, no direct commits
- Deployment triggers: Only from main branch merges after tests pass
- Rollback capability: Manual workflow triggers for deployment recovery

### Configuration Integration in Deployment
[Source: Story 5.1 implementation + config/generate-elm-config.js]
**Configuration Generation in Pipeline:**
- Build step must run `npm run generate:config` before compilation
- Utils/ConfigGenerated.elm auto-generated from config/equipment-defaults.json
- Configuration validation occurs during build (fails on malformed JSON)
- No runtime configuration loading - all config baked into compiled application

### File Locations for Deployment Configuration
[Source: Current project structure + deployment requirements]
**Implementation File Paths:**
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-static.yml` (REPLACE existing ci.yml)
- Build output directory: `frontend/dist/` (contains compiled static files)
- Custom domain file: `frontend/public/CNAME` (for custom domain configuration)
- Repository settings: GitHub repository → Settings → Pages (deployment source configuration)

### Testing Requirements for Deployment Pipeline
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md + current test structure]
**Deployment Validation Testing:**
- Unit tests: All existing tests must pass before deployment
- Build validation: Compilation and bundling must succeed
- Configuration tests: Config generation and validation must complete
- E2E tests: Basic functionality verification in deployed environment
- Performance validation: Build process optimization and bundle size verification

### Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

#### Test File Locations
- Deployment process tests: `frontend/tests/Integration/DeploymentTests.elm` (CREATE)
- Build pipeline tests: `frontend/tests/Unit/BuildProcessTests.elm` (UPDATE)
- GitHub Actions workflow validation: `.github/workflows/test-deployment.yml` (CREATE for workflow testing)

#### Test Standards and Frameworks
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]
- E2E tests: Cypress for deployment validation and post-deploy functionality verification
- Integration tests: Elm Test for build process and configuration integration testing
- Workflow validation: GitHub Actions testing with matrix builds for reliability
- Performance testing: Build process timing and bundle size validation

#### Deployment-Specific Testing Requirements
Test scenarios to cover for this story:
- GitHub Actions workflow executes successfully with proper Node.js and Elm setup
- Build process includes all required steps: config generation, formatting, compilation, testing
- Deployment to gh-pages branch completes without errors
- Static files deployed correctly with proper asset optimization
- HTTPS certificate provisioning works with custom domain configuration
- Branch protection rules prevent unauthorized deployments
- Rollback procedures function correctly when deployment fails
- Build pipeline fails appropriately when tests or formatting validation fails
