## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Build-time configuration system with Utils.ConfigGenerated successfully implemented
- npm run generate:config integration proven to work reliably in build pipeline
- Build process validation and error handling patterns established
- Comprehensive testing approach with integration tests validated deployment workflow
- Documentation with troubleshooting guides proven effective for operational procedures

### GitHub Actions Deployment Architecture
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]
**Current Architecture Requirements:**
- Platform: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Build Command: `npm run build` (Parcel bundling with Tailwind CSS processing)  
- Output Directory: `frontend/dist/` containing optimized static files
- CDN/Edge: GitHub Pages global CDN for worldwide content delivery

**Deployment Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
# Template from deployment-architecture.md
name: Deploy Static Site
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  ELM_VERSION: '0.19.1'
jobs:
  test: # Run tests first
  deploy: # Deploy only after tests pass
```

### Tech Stack Requirements for Deployment
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Critical Technologies for Deployment:**
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Latest) - Built into GitHub, no additional tools needed
- Build Tool: Elm Compiler (0.19.1) - Type checking and JavaScript compilation
- Bundler: Parcel (2.0+) - Zero-config bundling with hot reload and optimization
- Frontend Framework: Elm (0.19.1) - Compiled to JavaScript for static hosting
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (3.4+) - Utility-first styling with purging for small bundles

### Project Structure for Deployment Pipeline
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#github-workflows]
**Expected GitHub Actions Location:**
```
├── .github/                              # CI/CD workflows
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── elm-ci.yml                   # Elm build and test pipeline
│       ├── deploy-static.yml            # Deploy to GitHub Pages
│       └── fsharp-ci.yml               # Future F# backend CI
```

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- Existing: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (basic CI without deployment)
- Required: Replace with comprehensive `deploy-static.yml` for GitHub Pages deployment
- Frontend build output: `frontend/dist/` directory for static file deployment

### Current Build Process Integration Requirements
[Source: Current package.json + config system]
**Essential Build Steps for Deployment:**
1. Configuration generation: `npm run generate:config` (creates Utils/ConfigGenerated.elm)
2. Elm formatting validation: `npm run format:check` (prevents deployment of unformatted code)  
3. Project compilation: `npm run build` (Parcel bundling with Tailwind processing)
4. Test execution: `npm test` (comprehensive test suite validation)

**Build Dependencies from Tech Stack:**
- Node.js 18+ for npm scripts and build tooling
- Elm 0.19.1 for frontend compilation
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for styling with build-time purging

### GitHub Pages Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-strategy]
**Repository Configuration:**
- Deploy from: gh-pages branch (automated by GitHub Actions)
- Source folder: root (contains all static files from frontend/dist/)
- Domain configuration: Custom domain support with CNAME file
- HTTPS: Enforced with auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificates

**Expected Deployment URLs:**
- Production: https://your-domain.github.io/PondDiggingCalculator
- With custom domain: https://your-custom-domain.com

### Deployment Pipeline Security and Protection
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#environments]
**Branch Protection Requirements:**
- Main branch: Require status checks, prevent direct pushes
- gh-pages branch: Automated deployment only, no direct commits
- Deployment triggers: Only from main branch merges after tests pass
- Rollback capability: Manual workflow triggers for deployment recovery

### Configuration Integration in Deployment
[Source: Story 5.1 implementation + config/generate-elm-config.js]
**Configuration Generation in Pipeline:**
- Build step must run `npm run generate:config` before compilation
- Utils/ConfigGenerated.elm auto-generated from config/equipment-defaults.json
- Configuration validation occurs during build (fails on malformed JSON)
- No runtime configuration loading - all config baked into compiled application

### File Locations for Deployment Configuration
[Source: Current project structure + deployment requirements]
**Implementation File Paths:**
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-static.yml` (REPLACE existing ci.yml)
- Build output directory: `frontend/dist/` (contains compiled static files)
- Custom domain file: `frontend/public/CNAME` (for custom domain configuration)
- Repository settings: GitHub repository → Settings → Pages (deployment source configuration)

### Testing Requirements for Deployment Pipeline
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md + current test structure]
**Deployment Validation Testing:**
- Unit tests: All existing tests must pass before deployment
- Build validation: Compilation and bundling must succeed
- Configuration tests: Config generation and validation must complete
- E2E tests: Basic functionality verification in deployed environment
- Performance validation: Build process optimization and bundle size verification

- Follows project's build process requirements exactly (config generation, validation, formatting)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Minor inconsistencies in GitHub Actions versions between workflows were corrected
- Build process was simplified to use the existing npm run build script for consistency

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-static.yml`
  - **Change**: Simplified build step from custom command sequence to `npm run build`
  - **Why**: The package.json already defines the complete build process including validation, config generation, formatting, and compilation
  - **How**: Reduces duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistency with local development builds

- **File**: `.github/workflows/rollback.yml`
  - **Change**: Updated GitHub Actions versions from v2/v3 to v3/v4 for consistency
  - **Why**: Mixed action versions can cause compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities
  - **How**: Standardizes on latest stable versions across all workflows for better security and feature support

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Workflow files follow YAML best practices, build process matches project requirements
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed in correct locations (.github/workflows/, docs/deployment/, frontend/public/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test suite runs before deployment, existing BuildProcessTests covers deployment requirements
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented with proper validation

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Simplified build process to use existing npm run build script (deploy-static.yml)
- [x] Updated GitHub Actions versions for security and consistency (rollback.yml)
- [x] Verified all tests pass (473 tests successful)
- [x] Confirmed Elm formatting compliance
- [x] Validated build process includes all required steps (config generation, validation, compilation)

### Security Review

✓ **Proper Permissions**: Workflows use minimal required permissions (contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write)
✓ **Branch Protection**: Documentation includes proper branch protection setup for main branch
✓ **Deployment Security**: GitHub Actions deployment uses built-in GITHUB_TOKEN, no custom secrets required
✓ **Rollback Safety**: Manual rollback workflow prevents accidental rollbacks with required inputs

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Efficient Builds**: Build process runs in parallel with proper artifact caching
✓ **CDN Optimization**: GitHub Pages provides global CDN automatically
✓ **Bundle Optimization**: Parcel build process includes minification and tree-shaking
✓ **Dependency Caching**: Node.js cache configured in workflows for faster builds

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The deployment setup is production-ready and follows all architectural requirements. The implementation demonstrates excellent understanding of modern DevOps practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation, and robust error handling. The GitHub Pages deployment system is properly configured to automatically deploy from the main branch after all tests pass.
