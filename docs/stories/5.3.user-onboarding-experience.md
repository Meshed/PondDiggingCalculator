### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.2 Dev Agent Record]
- GitHub Pages deployment pipeline successfully established with proper testing integration
- Build process validation patterns proven effective for ensuring quality deployments
- Comprehensive documentation approach with troubleshooting guides effective for user guidance
- Configuration system working reliably with Utils/ConfigGenerated integration
- Responsive design patterns established across existing components

### Frontend Architecture Requirements for Onboarding
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
**Component Structure for Onboarding:**
- New Components needed: `WelcomeOverlay.elm`, `GuidedTour.elm`, `OnboardingManager.elm`
- Integration with existing: `DeviceDetector.elm` for responsive behavior, `Main.elm` for state coordination
- State management: Add onboarding state to Model with first-time user tracking
- Local storage: Use `Utils/Storage.elm` for persistent onboarding completion tracking

**State Management Integration:**
```elm
-- Addition to Model type
type alias Model =
    { -- existing fields...
    , onboardingState : OnboardingState
    , showWelcomeOverlay : Bool
    , currentTourStep : Maybe TourStep
    , isFirstTimeUser : Bool
    }

type OnboardingState
    = NotStarted
    | WelcomeShown
    | TourInProgress Int  -- step number
    | ExampleShown
    | Completed

type TourStep
    = IntroStep
    | EquipmentStep
    | ProjectFormStep
    | ResultsStep
    | CompletionStep
```

### Component Specifications for Onboarding
[Source: architecture/components.md#main-application-component]
**WelcomeOverlay Component:**
- Responsibility: First-time user welcome and tour initiation
- Dependencies: LocalStorage for first-visit detection, DeviceDetector for responsive layout
- Technology: Elm HTML with Tailwind CSS modal styling, responsive overlay design

**GuidedTour Component:**
- Responsibility: Step-by-step feature highlighting with navigation controls
- Key Interfaces: `startTour : Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`, `nextStep : TourStep -> TourStep`, `highlightElement : String -> Html Msg`
- Dependencies: DOM element targeting, tooltip positioning, responsive behavior
- Technology: Elm DOM manipulation, CSS positioning for highlights and tooltips

**OnboardingManager Component:**
- Responsibility: Coordinate onboarding flow and state transitions
- Key Interfaces: `initializeOnboarding : Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`, `completeOnboarding : Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`
- Dependencies: All other onboarding components, local storage, device detection

### Data Models for Onboarding State
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#application-model]
**Extended Model Types:**
```elm
type alias ExampleScenario =
    { projectName : String
    , description : String
    , excavatorSpec : Excavator
    , truckSpec : Truck
    , pondDimensions : PondDimensions
    , expectedTimeline : Int  -- days
    , explanation : String
    }

-- Add to ValidationState
type OnboardingField
    = WelcomeMessage
    | TourStep
    | ExampleScenario

-- Integration with existing FieldId type
type FieldId
    = -- existing field types...
    | OnboardingField OnboardingField
```

### Device-Responsive Onboarding Behavior
[Source: architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
**Device-Specific Adaptations:**
- Mobile: Simplified welcome message, swipe-enabled tour navigation, condensed example display
- Tablet: Medium complexity tour with touch-optimized interactions
- Desktop: Full-featured tour with hover states and detailed explanations

**Responsive Implementation:**
```elm
-- Device-specific onboarding configuration
getOnboardingConfig : DeviceType -> OnboardingConfig
getOnboardingConfig deviceType =
    case deviceType of
        Mobile ->
            { tourSteps = simplifiedTourSteps
            , gestureEnabled = True
            , overlayStyle = mobileOverlayClasses
            }
        Tablet ->
            { tourSteps = standardTourSteps
            , gestureEnabled = True
            , overlayStyle = tabletOverlayClasses
            }
        Desktop ->
            { tourSteps = detailedTourSteps
            , gestureEnabled = False
            , overlayStyle = desktopOverlayClasses
            }
```

### Core Workflows Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-calculation-workflow]
**Onboarding Workflow Integration:**
- Modify existing User Calculation Workflow to include onboarding checks
- Add onboarding state validation before allowing user input
- Integrate example scenario loading with existing EquipmentFleetManager and ProjectConfigurationManager
- Ensure onboarding completion triggers normal calculation workflow

**Example Scenario Workflow:**
```elm
-- Integration with existing workflow
loadExampleScenario : Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
loadExampleScenario model =
    let
        exampleExcavator = { defaultExcavator | bucketCapacity = 2.5, cycleTime = 2.0, name = "CAT 320 Excavator" }
        exampleTruck = { defaultTruck | capacity = 12.0, roundTripTime = 15.0, name = "Volvo A30G Truck" }
        examplePond = { length = 50.0, width = 30.0, depth = 6.0, volume = 333.33, shape = Rectangular }
        exampleProject = { workHoursPerDay = 8.0, projectName = Just "Residential Backyard Pond", location = Just "Example Location", pondDimensions = examplePond }
        
        updatedModel = 
            { model 
            | excavators = [exampleExcavator]
            , trucks = [exampleTruck]
            , projectConfig = exampleProject
            , onboardingState = ExampleShown
            }
    in
    -- Trigger calculation with example values
    (updatedModel, Cmd.batch [calculateTimeline updatedModel])
```

### Local Storage Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
**Storage Requirements:**
- Key: "pondCalculator.onboardingCompleted" (Boolean)
- Key: "pondCalculator.tourPreferences" (JSON with user preferences)
- Integration with existing `Utils/Storage.elm` module
- Error handling for storage unavailable scenarios

**Storage Functions:**
```elm
-- Add to Utils/Storage.elm
saveOnboardingState : OnboardingState -> Cmd Msg
saveOnboardingState state = 
    encodeOnboardingState state
        |> Json.Encode.encode 0
        |> setStorageItem "pondCalculator.onboardingState"

loadOnboardingState : () -> Cmd Msg
loadOnboardingState _ =
    getStorageItem "pondCalculator.onboardingState"
        |> Task.map (Maybe.withDefault "null" >> decodeOnboardingState)
        |> Task.perform OnboardingStateLoaded
```

### Styling and Theme Integration
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture + tech-stack.md]
**Tailwind CSS Class Requirements:**
- Modal/Overlay classes: backdrop blur, z-index layering, responsive positioning
- Tour highlight classes: border highlighting, spotlight effects, tooltip styling
- Button styling: Primary CTA buttons, secondary actions, mobile-optimized touch targets
- Animation classes: Smooth transitions, fade effects, progressive disclosure animations

**Theme Integration:**
```elm
-- Add to Styles/Theme.elm
welcomeOverlayClasses : String
welcomeOverlayClasses = "fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black bg-opacity-50 backdrop-blur-sm"

tourHighlightClasses : String
tourHighlightClasses = "relative z-40 ring-4 ring-blue-500 ring-opacity-75 rounded-lg shadow-xl"

onboardingButtonClasses : String
onboardingButtonClasses = "bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg text-lg transition-colors duration-200"
```

- Conditionally render onboarding components in view
- Initialize onboarding state detection on app startup

**Device Integration:**
- Use existing DeviceDetector for responsive onboarding behavior
- Adapt tour steps and overlay sizing based on detected device type
- Implement touch gestures for mobile tour navigation

### Example Scenario Technical Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-models.md + domain knowledge]
**Realistic Example Values:**
- Project: "Small Residential Pond" - 50' x 30' x 6' = ~333 cubic yards
- Excavator: CAT 320 with 2.5 cy bucket, 2-minute cycle time
- Truck: 12 cy capacity, 15-minute round trip time
- Expected timeline: ~1 day with proper equipment balance
- Work hours: Standard 8-hour day

**Example Narrative:**
"This example shows a typical backyard pond project. A homeowner wants to add a decorative water feature to their landscaping. The excavation requires removing about 333 cubic yards of soil, which our calculator estimates will take about 1 day with the right equipment."
