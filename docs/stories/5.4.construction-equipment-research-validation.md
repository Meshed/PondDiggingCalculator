### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.3 Dev Agent Record]
- User onboarding system successfully implemented with example scenario functionality
- Configuration system integration proven reliable with Utils/ConfigGenerated loading
- Example scenario uses realistic project values that will benefit from research validation
- Onboarding example uses: CAT 320 Excavator (2.5 cy, 2.0 min), Volvo A30G Truck (12.0 cy, 15.0 min)
- These example values should be validated against research findings for consistency

### Current Configuration Analysis
[Source: frontend/public/config.json]
**Current Default Values:**
- Excavator: bucketCapacity 2.5 cy, cycleTime 2.0 min, name "CAT 320 Excavator"
- Truck: capacity 12.0 cy, roundTripTime 15.0 min, name "Standard Dump Truck"
- Validation Ranges: excavator capacity 0.1-15.0 cy, cycle time 0.5-10.0 min, truck capacity 5.0-50.0 cy, round-trip time 5.0-120.0 min

**Research Requirements:**
- Validate 2.5 cy bucket capacity for CAT 320 model against manufacturer specs
- Research if 2.0 minute cycle time is realistic for residential pond excavation
- Verify 12.0 cy truck capacity represents typical dump truck specifications
- Validate 15.0 minute round-trip time for suburban construction site conditions

### Data Models for Equipment Configuration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#excavator]
**Equipment Type Structure:**
```elm
type alias Excavator =
    { id : EquipmentId
    , bucketCapacity : Float  -- cubic yards (research target: validate 0.5-15.0 range)
    , cycleTime : Float       -- minutes (research target: validate 0.5-10.0 range)
    , name : String          -- manufacturer and model designation
    , isActive : Bool
    }

type alias Truck =
    { id : EquipmentId
    , capacity : Float        -- cubic yards (research target: validate 5.0-30.0 range)
    , roundTripTime : Float   -- minutes (research target: validate 5.0-60.0 range)
    , name : String
    , isActive : Bool
    }
```
