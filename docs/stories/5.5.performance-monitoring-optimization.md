## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.4 Dev Agent Record]
- Configuration system performance validation completed: 473 tests pass in 241ms
- No performance degradation from configuration changes - JSON loading efficient
- Auto-generated Elm module (ConfigGenerated.elm) compiles efficiently
- Testing framework baseline established for performance regression detection
- Configuration loading performance maintained despite JSON structure additions

### Performance Monitoring Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
**State Integration for Performance Tracking:**
- Performance metrics must integrate with existing Model state structure
- Use Elm's Command pattern for performance measurement side effects
- Performance data collection must not interfere with calculation workflow
- Leverage existing sessionStartTime and lastCalculationTime patterns

**Model Integration Requirements:**
```elm
-- Extend existing Model with performance tracking
type alias Model =
    { -- existing fields...
    , sessionStartTime : Time.Posix
    , lastCalculationTime : Time.Posix
    -- NEW: Performance tracking fields
    , performanceMetrics : PerformanceMetrics
    , developmentMode : Bool  -- controls console logging
    }
```

### Performance Metrics Data Model
[Source: architecture/data-models.md + coding standards]
**Performance Type Definitions Required:**
```elm
-- Following Elm type safety patterns for performance data
type alias PerformanceMetrics =
    { loadTime : Maybe Float           -- application load time in ms
    , calculationTime : Maybe Float    -- last calculation duration in ms
    , averageCalculationTime : Float   -- running average for trend analysis
    , calculationCount : Int           -- total calculations performed
    , performanceBudgetViolations : List BudgetViolation
    , sessionDuration : Float          -- current session length in ms
    }

type alias BudgetViolation =
    { metric : PerformanceMetric
    , actualValue : Float
    , budgetLimit : Float
    , timestamp : Time.Posix
    }

type PerformanceMetric
    = LoadTime
    | CalculationDuration
    | TotalMemoryUsage
```

### Real-time Calculation Performance Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
**Performance Measurement Integration Points:**
- Measurement must not impact the <100ms calculation performance target
- Performance timing should integrate with existing debounce input pattern (300ms)
- Timing measurements needed at: Input validation, Calculation engine execution, Results display update
- Performance metrics must follow the existing real-time update workflow without disruption

**Calculation Engine Performance Requirements:**
- Performance.start() before Utils/Calculations.elm function calls
- Performance.end() after calculation completion
- Performance budget validation must not slow down calculation workflow
- Console logging only in development mode to avoid production performance impact

### Tech Stack Performance Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**No External Dependencies Constraint:**
- Performance monitoring must use only Browser API (Navigation.Key, Time, Task)
- No external monitoring services (aligns with "zero infrastructure costs" MVP goal)
- Console logging uses Browser.console functions, not external libraries
- Performance measurement uses browser Performance API through Elm ports if needed

**Development vs Production Requirements:**
- Development builds: Full console logging and performance metrics display
- Production builds: Metrics collection only, no console output or debug displays
- Use Elm's Debug module conditionally for development-only features
- Parcel bundler must exclude development logging from production bundles

### File Location and Project Structure Integration
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**New Files Required:**
- `frontend/src/Utils/Performance.elm` - Core performance monitoring module (NEW)
- `frontend/src/Types/Performance.elm` - Performance data types (NEW)
- No changes to existing calculation or component files - purely additive

**Integration Points:**
- Update `frontend/src/Types/Model.elm` to include PerformanceMetrics field
- Update `frontend/src/Main.elm` to initialize performance tracking
- Integration with existing `frontend/src/Utils/Calculations.elm` for timing measurement
- No changes to component files - performance monitoring is utility-level concern

### Configuration and Build System Integration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#build-tool-bundler]
**Parcel Build Optimization Requirements:**
- Configure Parcel tree-shaking for production performance optimization
- Enable Parcel minification and compression for load time optimization
- Set up conditional compilation for development vs production logging
- Optimize bundle splitting if load time analysis identifies large bundle issues

**Performance Budget Integration:**
```elm
-- Performance budget constants (no external dependencies)
performanceBudgets : PerformanceBudgets
performanceBudgets =
    { maxLoadTime = 3000.0        -- 3 seconds for construction site connections
    , maxCalculationTime = 1000.0  -- 1 second (sub-second target with buffer)
    , maxBundleSize = 500.0       -- KB - reasonable for mobile construction sites
    }
```

### Testing Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Performance Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for performance measurement accuracy in `frontend/tests/Unit/PerformanceTests.elm`
- Integration tests for performance monitoring integration in `frontend/tests/Integration/`
- Performance regression testing to ensure monitoring doesn't slow down calculations
- Test performance budget validation logic with known slow/fast scenarios

### Browser API and Port Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#functional-transformations]
**Performance API Integration:**
- Use Elm ports to access browser Performance API for load time measurement
- Implement functional patterns for performance data transformation and analysis
- Use Result types for performance measurement operations that can fail
- Follow pure function patterns - performance measurement as side effects through Cmd

**Console Logging Architecture:**
```elm
-- Development-only console logging port
port consoleLogPerformance : String -> Cmd msg

-- Performance measurement through browser timing API
port measurePerformance : String -> Cmd msg
port performanceMeasured : (Float -> msg) -> Sub msg
```

### Load Time Optimization Strategy
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + performance requirements]
**Construction Site Connection Considerations:**
- Target 3-second load time on 3G connections
- Optimize critical CSS delivery for fastest first paint
- Leverage browser caching for configuration and static assets
- Use Parcel code splitting to minimize initial bundle size
- Prioritize calculation engine loading over secondary features

**Bundle Optimization Targets:**
- Initial bundle: <200KB compressed (critical path)
- Configuration loading: <50KB (equipment defaults and validation)
- Secondary features: Can be lazy-loaded after initial calculation capability

### Development vs Production Performance Features
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration-over-code]
**Development Mode Features:**
- Detailed console logging of all performance metrics
- Performance metrics overlay in browser for debugging
- Performance budget violation alerts and warnings
- Detailed timing breakdown for all calculation steps

**Production Mode Features:**
- Silent performance metrics collection only
- Performance data available for future external monitoring integration
- No console output or debug displays that could impact user experience
- Optimized bundle with all development logging stripped out

## Testing

- **Integration Testing:** Performance monitoring integration with existing Model update cycle, performance measurement integration with calculation workflow, performance budget violation detection and logging
- **Performance Regression Testing:** Validate that performance monitoring adds <1ms overhead to calculations, ensure development vs production mode logging works correctly, verify performance budget thresholds trigger appropriately

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Test performance measurement accuracy within acceptable margin of error
- Verify performance budget validation triggers correctly for slow operations
- Test development vs production mode feature differences
- Validate performance metrics collection doesn't impact application functionality
- Test console logging works in development builds but is excluded from production builds
- Verify performance monitoring framework can be extended for future enhancements
