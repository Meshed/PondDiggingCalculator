## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5, established patterns and architecture in place:
- Elm Architecture with centralized state management in Model
- Pure functional calculations in `Utils/Calculations.elm` 
- Result type error handling with ValidationEngine patterns
- Component structure with `Components/ProjectForm.elm` and `Components/ResultsPanel.elm` already implemented
- Device-responsive behavior with `Types/DeviceType.elm` 
- Comprehensive testing framework with elm-test (86 tests passing)

### Core Workflows for Real-time Updates
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
The architecture defines the exact real-time update workflow:
```
User types in input field -> Input Component -> ValidationEngine -> CalculationEngine -> ResultsDisplayManager
```
Key requirements:
- Input debouncing (300ms) to prevent excessive calculations
- Validation before calculation trigger 
- Calculation performance target <100ms
- Immediate display updates for valid results
- Error state display without blocking valid calculations

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
Current Model structure supports real-time updates:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { excavators : List Excavator
    , trucks : List Truck  
    , projectConfig : ProjectConfiguration
    , currentResult : Maybe CalculationResult
    , deviceType : DeviceType
    , validationState : ValidationState
    , calculationInProgress : Bool
    , lastCalculationTime : Time.Posix
    }
```
Critical elements for real-time:
- `currentResult : Maybe CalculationResult` - holds latest calculation
- `calculationInProgress : Bool` - prevents race conditions
- `lastCalculationTime : Time.Posix` - performance tracking
- `validationState : ValidationState` - manages error states

### Message Types for Real-time Updates
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#field-validation-types]
Required message types for immediate input handling:
```elm
type Msg
    = ExcavatorFieldChanged EquipmentId ExcavatorField String
    | TruckFieldChanged EquipmentId TruckField String
    | PondFieldChanged PondField String
    | ProjectFieldChanged ProjectField String
    | CalculationCompleted (Result CalculationError CalculationResult)
    | PerformanceTracked Float -- milliseconds
```
Field types already defined in data models:
- `ExcavatorField = BucketCapacity | CycleTime | ExcavatorName`
- `TruckField = TruckCapacity | RoundTripTime | TruckName`
- `PondField = PondLength | PondWidth | PondDepth`
- `ProjectField = WorkHours | ProjectName | Location`

### Calculation Engine Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#calculationengine]
Calculation engine interfaces designed for real-time:
- `performCalculation : List Excavator -> List Truck -> ProjectConfiguration -> Result CalculationError CalculationResult`
- Pure functions with no side effects - enables fast execution
- No external dependencies - eliminates async bottlenecks
- Performance target <100ms established in requirements

### Validation Engine Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#validationengine]
Validation engine supports real-time error handling:
- `validateField : FieldId -> String -> Result ValidationError Float`
- `getFieldError : FieldId -> ValidationState -> Maybe ValidationError`
- `formatErrorMessage : ValidationError -> String`
- Error states maintain previous valid calculations per AC 4

### Component Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md]
Key components for real-time updates:
- **ProjectConfigurationManager**: Handles pond dimensions and work hours input changes
- **EquipmentFleetManager**: Manages excavator and truck parameter changes 
- **ValidationEngine**: Validates each input change before calculation trigger
- **CalculationEngine**: Performs rapid recalculation for valid inputs
- **ResultsDisplayManager**: Updates display with new results or error indicators

### Performance Monitoring Implementation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#pure-function-calculations]
Performance tracking requirements:
- Monitor calculation execution time using `Time.now` before/after
- Log performance data to browser console during development
- Add warning indicators if calculations exceed 100ms threshold
- Track performance degradation with fleet size increases

### Input Debouncing Strategy
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
Debouncing implementation per workflow specification:
- 300ms debounce timeout for input fields
- Cancel previous debounce timer on new input
- Immediate validation, delayed calculation trigger
- Use Elm Process.sleep for debounce implementation

### Device-Specific Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
Device-responsive performance optimization:
- Mobile devices may need longer debounce (500ms) due to slower processing
- Desktop can handle more frequent updates
- Consider simplified calculations on mobile for better performance
- Use `DeviceType` to adjust debounce timing dynamically

### File Locations for Implementation
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Implementation locations:
- **Message Types**: `frontend/src/Types/Messages.elm` - add real-time input messages
- **Input Handling**: `frontend/src/Components/ProjectForm.elm` - modify for instant updates
- **Equipment Updates**: `frontend/src/Components/EquipmentCard.elm` - add real-time field changes
- **Performance Tracking**: `frontend/src/Utils/Performance.elm` - NEW FILE for monitoring
- **Debounce Logic**: `frontend/src/Utils/Debounce.elm` - NEW FILE for input debouncing

### Error Handling Patterns
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-result-types]
Real-time error handling approach:
```elm
-- Preserve last valid calculation during validation errors
type alias Model =
    { currentResult : Maybe CalculationResult  -- last valid calculation
    , calculationInProgress : Bool
    , validationState : ValidationState
    , lastValidInputs : Maybe ValidatedInputs  -- rollback data
    }
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Specific testing requirements for real-time functionality:
- **Unit Tests**: Test rapid input change scenarios in `frontend/tests/Unit/RealTimeTests.elm`
- **Performance Tests**: Verify <100ms calculation times under various fleet sizes
- **Integration Tests**: Test validation/calculation/display pipeline timing
- **Debounce Tests**: Verify 300ms debounce behavior with rapid input sequences
- **Error State Tests**: Verify valid results preserved during validation errors

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Test File Locations
This story requires new test files for real-time functionality:
- **Real-time Tests**: `frontend/tests/Unit/RealTimeTests.elm` - test immediate input handling
- **Performance Tests**: `frontend/tests/Unit/PerformanceTests.elm` - verify calculation speed
- **Debounce Tests**: `frontend/tests/Unit/DebounceTests.elm` - test input debouncing behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Update `frontend/tests/Integration/ComponentTests.elm` with real-time flows

### Testing Standards for Real-time Features
All tests must follow established patterns:
```elm
test "should_update_calculation_within_100ms_of_input_change" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            startTime = Time.millisToPosix 0
            model = testModelWithDefaults
            updatedModel = updateExcavatorCapacity "2.5" model
        in
        case updatedModel.currentResult of
            Just result ->
                -- Verify calculation completed and within time bounds
                result.timelineInDays |> Expect.greaterThan 0
            Nothing ->
                Expect.fail "Calculation should complete immediately for valid input"
```

Performance testing requirements:
- Measure calculation time for various fleet sizes (1-10 excavators, 1-5 trucks)
- Verify debounce timing accuracy (300ms ± 10ms tolerance)
- Test rapid input sequences don't cause race conditions
- Validate memory usage doesn't grow with rapid updates
