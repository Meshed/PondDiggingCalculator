## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.1 and 2.2 Dev Agent Records]
- Desktop/Tablet rich interface successfully implemented with enhanced visual representations and detailed results display
- Mobile simplified interface working with calculator-style patterns and single-equipment configuration
- Device detection logic established using DeviceDetector.elm with proper Mobile/Tablet/Desktop breakpoints
- Shared state architecture implemented where device type affects presentation only, not core data
- Real-time calculation updates working within 100ms performance target across all device types

### Device Type Detection and Breakpoints
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#DeviceType, Utils/DeviceDetector.elm]
Device breakpoints and detection:
```elm
type DeviceType = Mobile | Tablet | Desktop

-- Breakpoint definitions from DeviceDetector.elm
Mobile: < 768px width
Tablet: 768px - 1024px width  
Desktop: > 1024px width

-- Device-specific feature availability
shouldShowAdvancedFeatures : DeviceType -> Bool
shouldShowAdvancedFeatures deviceType =
    case deviceType of
        Mobile -> False      -- Simplified interface only
        Tablet -> True       -- Full functionality
        Desktop -> True      -- Full functionality
```

### Calculation Engine Consistency Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow, Utils/Calculations.elm]
Cross-device calculation requirements:
- All devices must use identical `calculateTimeline` function from Utils/Calculations.elm
- Calculation precision must be consistent regardless of display device
- Real-time updates must complete within 100ms target on all device types
- Mobile simplified display should show same timeline result as desktop detailed display

### Validation Engine Consistency
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#validation-at-boundaries, Utils/Validation.elm]
Validation consistency requirements:
- All device types must use identical validation functions from Utils/Validation.elm
- Validation errors must use same ValidationError types and messages
- Input boundaries must be identical: bucket capacity (0.1-15.0), truck capacity (1.0-50.0), etc.
- Error display may differ by device (mobile vs desktop styling) but error content must be identical

### Data Model State Management
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#application-model, Types/Model.elm]
State consistency across devices:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { excavators : List Excavator
    , trucks : List Truck  
    , projectConfig : ProjectConfiguration
    , currentResult : Maybe CalculationResult
    , deviceType : DeviceType                -- Only affects presentation
    , validationState : ValidationState      -- Must be identical across devices
    , nextEquipmentId : Int
    }
```

### Browser Compatibility Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
Target browser matrix for testing:
- Desktop: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+ at >1024px width
- Tablet: Safari iPad, Chrome tablet at 768-1024px width
- Mobile: Chrome mobile, Safari mobile at <768px width
- Elm 0.19.1 compilation ensures cross-browser JavaScript compatibility

### Configuration Loading Consistency
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, Utils/Config.elm]
Default value loading:
- config.json must load identically across all device types
- Default excavator: bucketCapacity=2.5, cycleTime=2.0
- Default truck: capacity=12.0, roundTripTime=15.0
- Default project: workHoursPerDay=8.0
- Configuration loading errors must be handled consistently

### Real-Time Update Performance Standards
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#real-time-calculation-update-workflow]
Performance consistency requirements:
- Input debouncing: 300ms delay identical across all devices
- Calculation execution: <100ms on all device types
- UI update rendering: Immediate display update after calculation completion
- No performance degradation on device type transitions

### Device Transition State Preservation
[Source: Previous stories implementation, Main.elm routing]
State preservation requirements:
- User input values must persist during browser resize events
- Calculation results must remain displayed during device breakpoint transitions
- Validation error states must be preserved across device type changes
- Mobile-to-desktop transition should expand interface without losing data

### File Locations for Cross-Device Testing Implementation
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Test implementation paths:
- Cross-device tests: `frontend/tests/Integration/CrossDeviceTests.elm` (NEW)
- Browser compatibility tests: `frontend/tests/E2E/BrowserCompatibilityTests.elm` (NEW)
- Update existing: `frontend/tests/Unit/CalculationTests.elm` (ADD cross-device scenarios)
- Update existing: `frontend/tests/Unit/ValidationTests.elm` (ADD device consistency tests)

### Component Architecture for Device Consistency
[Source: architecture/components.md#deviceadaptiveinterface]
Device adaptation patterns:
- DeviceAdaptiveInterface component manages device-specific presentation only
- Core business logic (calculations, validation) must be device-agnostic
- Visual differences allowed but functional behavior must be identical
- Mobile shows simplified results, desktop shows detailed results, but underlying data identical

                    ]
        ]
```
