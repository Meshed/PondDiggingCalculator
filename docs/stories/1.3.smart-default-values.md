# Story 1.3: Smart Default Values

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to see realistic equipment values pre-populated in all fields,
**so that** I can understand the tool's purpose and get useful results without data entry.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All input fields display realistic default values based on common construction equipment
2. Default values represent typical mid-range excavator and truck specifications
3. Default configuration produces reasonable timeline estimate for reference pond size
4. Users can immediately see calculated result upon page load within 10 seconds
5. Default values can be easily modified while maintaining calculation functionality

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Enhance configuration loading for immediate default population (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Update `frontend/src/Utils/Config.elm` to load defaults on application initialization
  - [x] Ensure default values are immediately available when model is created
  - [x] Implement error handling for config loading failures with fallback defaults

- [x] Enhance user experience with meaningful default values (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Update default pond dimensions to produce realistic timeline (1-3 days)
  - [x] Ensure default equipment values represent common mid-range specifications
  - [x] Verify user can easily edit any default value while maintaining functionality
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for default value behavior (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `frontend/tests/Unit/DefaultValueTests.elm` testing immediate load behavior
  - [x] Test calculation performance with default configuration
  - [x] Test user modification of default values maintains functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2, the following is established and working:
- Configuration system with JSON decoders in `Utils/Config.elm` can load default values
- Core calculation engine performs calculations with pure functions
- Form components in `Components/ProjectForm.elm` handle input and validation
- Results display in `Components/ResultsPanel.elm` shows calculation output
- Real-time calculation updates are implemented in Main.elm

### Data Models Required
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
The story uses existing model structures but needs to ensure defaults are populated immediately:
```elm
type alias Model =
    { excavators : List Excavator
    , trucks : List Truck
    , projectConfig : ProjectConfiguration
    , currentResult : Maybe CalculationResult
    , deviceType : DeviceType
    , validationState : ValidationState
    , nextEquipmentId : Int
    }
```

Default values need to be populated into Excavator and Truck lists with realistic specifications:
```elm
-- Default excavator (from config.json)
defaultExcavator = 
    { id = EquipmentId "default-excavator-1"
    , bucketCapacity = 2.5  -- cubic yards (mid-range)
    , cycleTime = 2.0       -- minutes (efficient operation)
    , name = "Standard Excavator"
    , isActive = True
    }

-- Default truck (from config.json)  
defaultTruck =
    { id = EquipmentId "default-truck-1"
    , capacity = 12.0       -- cubic yards (common size)
    , roundTripTime = 15.0  -- minutes (reasonable distance)
    , name = "15-yard Dump Truck"
    , isActive = True
    }
```

### Configuration Values Available
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, from Story 1.2 implementation]
Default values are already defined in `frontend/public/config.json`:
```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "excavator": {
      "bucketCapacity": 2.5,
      "cycleTime": 2.0,
      "name": "Standard Excavator"
    },
    "truck": {
      "capacity": 12.0,
      "roundTripTime": 15.0,
      "name": "15-yard Dump Truck"
    },
    "project": {
      "workHoursPerDay": 8.0,
      "pondLength": 50.0,
      "pondWidth": 30.0,
      "pondDepth": 6.0
    }
  }
}
```

These values need to be loaded immediately on application initialization and populate the form fields and model.

### File Locations and Project Structure  
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Configuration loading: `frontend/src/Utils/Config.elm` (already exists, needs enhancement)
- Form component: `frontend/src/Components/ProjectForm.elm` (needs default population)
- Main application: `frontend/src/Main.elm` (needs initialization with defaults)
- Test file: `frontend/tests/Unit/DefaultValueTests.elm` (new file needed)

### Expected Calculation Result with Defaults
[Source: Story 1.2 implementation notes]
With default values (2.5cy excavator, 2min cycle, 12cy truck, 15min round-trip, 333cy pond):
- Expected timeline: ~1 day
- This provides a meaningful reference point for new users

### Performance Requirements
[Source: AC 4]
- Page load to calculated result display must complete within 10 seconds
- This requires immediate config loading, model initialization, and calculation execution
- Consider calculation caching for default configuration to improve performance

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Configuration Over Code**: Use config.json defaults, never hardcode default values
- **Pure Function Calculations**: Ensure calculations with defaults maintain pure function approach
- **Type Safety First**: Use Elm's type system for all default value handling
- **No Magic Numbers**: Default values come from configuration, not inline constants

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Elm 0.19.1 for configuration loading with JSON decoders
- Maintain pure functional approach for all default value handling
- Ensure browser compatibility for configuration loading
- Default initialization must not introduce side effects

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Test File Locations
- **Unit Tests**: `frontend/tests/Unit/DefaultValueTests.elm` for default loading behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Update existing `frontend/tests/Integration/ComponentTests.elm` for form initialization

### Test Standards
- Use elm-test framework with descriptive function names using underscores
- Test default value loading performance and accuracy
- Test user interaction with pre-populated fields

### Required Test Coverage
- Test immediate default value population on application initialization
- Test calculation execution with default configuration produces expected ~1 day result
- Test user modification of any default value maintains calculation functionality
- Test performance requirement: default loading and calculation within 10 seconds
- Test error handling when config.json loading fails (fallback defaults)

### Test Pattern Examples
```elm
test "should_populate_default_excavator_values_on_init" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            initialModel = initWithDefaults defaultConfig
        in
        initialModel.excavators
            |> List.head
            |> Maybe.map .bucketCapacity
            |> Expect.equal (Just 2.5)

test "should_calculate_timeline_immediately_with_defaults" <|
    \_ ->
        let
            initialModel = initWithDefaults defaultConfig
        in
        initialModel.currentResult
            |> Maybe.map .timelineInDays
            |> Expect.equal (Just 1)
```
