# Monitoring and Observability (MVP Approach)

**No monitoring or metrics collection in MVP phase** - Keep the application simple and focused on core functionality.

## Current Approach (MVP)

**Development Debugging Only:**
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use browser console and dev tools for debugging during development
- **Elm Debug Mode:** Elm's built-in debugging capabilities during development builds
- **Manual Testing:** Direct user testing and feedback collection
- **Simple Error Logging:** Basic console.log for development troubleshooting

**No Analytics or Tracking:**
- No user behavior tracking
- No performance metrics collection  
- No error reporting services
- No usage analytics
- Complete privacy - no data collection

## Future Considerations

When the application grows beyond MVP and monitoring becomes necessary:

1. **User Permission First:** Any future monitoring will be opt-in only
2. **Privacy-First Design:** No personal data collection, anonymous usage patterns only  
3. **Business Value Focus:** Monitor only metrics that directly improve user experience
4. **Simple Implementation:** Start with basic browser APIs, not complex monitoring services
