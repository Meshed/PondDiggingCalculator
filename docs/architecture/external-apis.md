# External APIs

**No external API integrations required for MVP phase.** The Pond Digging Calculator operates as a pure client-side application with all functionality contained within the browser environment.

## Future External API Considerations (Post-MVP)

When additional features are needed in future phases, the following external APIs may be integrated:

### Weather Service API (Future Enhancement)
- **Purpose:** Adjust calculations based on weather conditions affecting productivity
- **Integration Notes:** Would modify calculation multipliers based on precipitation, temperature

### Equipment Database API (Future Enhancement)
- **Purpose:** Access manufacturer specifications for excavators and dump trucks
- **Integration Notes:** Would populate equipment dropdowns with real manufacturer data
